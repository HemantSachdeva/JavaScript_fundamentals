# Fundamentals-of-JS
## Task20
### write a JS program to check if any of the three given integer values are in the range.


The range should be from 50 to 99 (inclusive). Return true if one or more of them are in the above range and false otherwise. Your output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (number1, number2, number3) as a parameter of your function.

Steps:

- You have to code in **task20.js** file
- Declare a result variable to store true or false.
- Use if to store true if `num1` or `num2`, or `num3` are in range 50...99
  - Think about the logic here
- Use else to store false if the conditions in if are not true
- Return the result variable
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
