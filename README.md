# Why Konfinity's worker called me?

Let's tell you what Konfinity does:

`Konfinity offers cutting edge online coding courses that train students and professionals to be software engineers, and helps them get placed in high paying jobs.`

# Conversation:

He: Hello Hemant, Good Evening!! I am xyz from Konfinity. If am not wrong you are in B. Tech CSE 2nd year.
Me: Yes. (Yeah no hello hi to strangers)

He: We provide online courses and.... (Description above). We have a free 3 days trial for Fundamentals of JavaScript for your college students as we have a Brand Ambassador from your college (Tells the name who really exists) and then you can decide if you want to persue the whole course of 6 months (4 months training + 2 months internship) worth `14,000 INR` after all discounts (Actual cost `33,000 INR`). So are you intrested?
Me: Okay I am convinced for the trial for now.

He: Great am making an account for you on our Workspace on GitLab and giving you access on the project. Sending you the Introduction tutorial how it works. You will be assigned a Mentor in 2 hours whome you can ask your queries or you can call me as well. And yeah whatsapp group is also there.
Me: Okay.

## Experience:
Well yeah I enjoyed the trial alot. Completed all 28 tasks in 2 days. They (mentor and consultant) used to call me twice a day if am facing any issue but their guides (I shared above) were crystal clear. Only the annoying thing was the pipeline üåù. Anyways it beatufies the code alot.

### What you are supposed to do?
Well it's an opensource now. The tasks are üíØ completed but respective `task*/README.md` says something more which is pending for you. (Bruh I have done all. Just saying u to complete if u are intrested in contributing and learning shits)

Pull Requests will be appriciated.
