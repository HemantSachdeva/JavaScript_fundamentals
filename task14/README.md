# Fundamentals-of-JS
## Task14
### write a JS program which calculates if the number is greater than 13 or less than 13.

 If the number is greater, the program finds the **difference between the input number and 13 and multiply it by 2 and returns the result. If the number is less than 13, the program calculate the difference between 13 and input number and returns the value as result**. Your output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (number) as parameter of your function.

Steps:

- You have to code in **task14.js** file
- Create a function with parameters to store input variables
- Define a new variable to store difference (difference will be stored further after calculation)
- Define a result variable to store output
- Use if to check condition 1 (number is less than 13)
  - Make your logic here accordingly and assign output to your result variable
- Use else to check condition 2 (number is greater than or equal to 13)
  - Make your logic here accordingly and assign output to your result variable
- Return the result variable 
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
